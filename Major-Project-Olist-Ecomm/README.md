Olist E-commerce - End-to-End Big Data ETL Pipeline

● Architected and implemented a complete ETL solution following the Medallion Architecture to process e-commerce data
from multiple sources (MySQL, MongoDB, JSON).
● Extract: Engineered ingestion pipelines in Azure Data Factory to dynamically pull raw data from various sources and land it
in the Bronze layer in Azure Data Lake Storage.
● Transform: Leveraged Azure Databricks and PySpark to perform complex transformations, aggregations, and data
enrichment, storing the cleaned, business-ready data in the Silver layer.
● Load: Utilized Azure Synapse Analytics to further refine the data in the Gold layer, preparing it for consumption by
analytics and visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau.
